# exectutive-2.0

The basic idea of our prototype is exploring  a place where suppliers of the industrial materials meet the retailers - A B2B solution. For instance, a cement industry needs some raw materials such as fly-ash, magnesium, gunny bags, etc but the business owner is stuck with the same suppliers for a long time, so for new opportunities and for development of the company he/she can explore new sellers for development of the company . These raw products need to possess high quality as it impacts a lot of aspects of an industry. The core goal of our prototype is to provide technology with total visibility throughout the process. Buyers can meet the sellers and they can choose the choice they like based on their requirements. We also want to provide the model with a complete data driven approach with a sprinkle of review analysis that is based on the concept of sentiment monitoring like evaluating brand mentions in terms of their emotional content and following up appropriately. We also plan on providing insights on sustainability of the business based on the surroundings and analyzing similar business around. Many enterprises get stale profits as they are stagnated with the same sellers all the time. But our solution fills this vacuum and gives them new and updated respective sellers. We also plan on providing an automated digital marketing platform or if a personal touch is needed with marketing, the model will collaborate with affiliate marketers. We planned on providing an user-friendly interface which helps all kinds of people to use it without hassle.
